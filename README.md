# Hospital Readmissions — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the **Hospital Readmissions** dataset from Kaggle (25,000 patient encounters).  
It focuses on **data cleaning, feature understanding, and clinical insights** that explain why patients return to the hospital.

## 🔍 Project Overview
- Cleaned categorical and numeric variables  
- Converted yes/no fields → binary (0/1)  
- Standardized missing values and category formatting  
- Explored patterns in age, stay duration, medications, and diagnoses  
- Analyzed readmission behavior and correlations  

## 📊 Key Insights
1. **Older adults dominate admissions** — most patients are 60–80 years old.
2. **Readmission is nearly balanced** (53% not readmitted vs 47% readmitted).
3. **Readmission risk increases with age**, especially from 70–90.
4. **Medication counts are heavily right-skewed**, indicating polypharmacy.
5. **No single numeric factor strongly predicts readmission** — it’s multifactorial.
